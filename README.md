# FirstBlog
So here I begin, this is my first Data Science and on the top of it first ever blog I am writing.
I wanted to share this new journey of mine from the very beginning. So I decided to write this even with very basic knowledge in this field. These days I am filled with the next level energy. I am enjoying my phase of learning. I cannot sleep at night thinking about what I would learn tomorrow and more appropriately when I will be able to compile all this knowledge and do something fruitful.
So, keeping my life aside. I wanted to go ahead with the topic.
Yes, Data Speaks A lot.
But We as humans unable to hear it. Seaborn and matplotlib like libraries provide great tools to convert that informative sound into interesting and understandable visuals. As humans perceive pictures quite well and interpret much faster. So here we gonna solve some of our questions through these visuals and plots.
Here I am importing Zomato Bangalore restaurant data set. And we will be answering a few questions clearly just by seeing some plots.
## Questions :
i. What are the top chains of restaurants in Bangalore?
ii. What are the most common types of restaurants in Bangalore?
iii. Most popular cuisine in Bangalore?
iv. How many restaurants accept online orders?
v. Various Types of Restaurants providing table bookings or not?



1. Importing required libraries.

2. Reading the dataset

3. Checking for NULL values.

the output is the sum of null values in individual column

HeatMap visualizing null values
4.Plotting a bar plot to answer our first question clearly

Code for the BarPlot

Required Bar Plot
It is clearly visible in the bar Graph that the top restaurant chains in Bangalore are of Cafe Coffee Day.

We can easily interpret in a second that the most types of restaurants are Quick Bites.

Bar plot Code and Output for the Cuisines
North Indian is the most demanded Cuisine and Bakery is the least demanded one in Bangalore.
5. Plotting a Pie Chart to depict the clear picture.

Pie chart evaluating the percentage of restaurants accepting online orders and not
Here clearly 58.9% of restaurants accept Online Orders. A major portion of restaurants accepts online orders. But there is also a significant count of the restaurants not accepting online orders.
6. A Count Plot

Code for plotting a count plot depicting booking facility is provided or not

Output
The plot clearly depicts only a smaller portion of restaurants allow Table Booking Facility.
So, that's all for the first time. I tried to make really simple observations from the data provided. Step by step I will head to the more complex Interpretations.

Thanks a lot.
